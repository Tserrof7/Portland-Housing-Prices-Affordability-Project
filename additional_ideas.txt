1. Descriptive Statistics
Mean YoY % Change: Average rent growth rate over the years for each county.
Variance: Shows the spread of the data (square of standard deviation).
Range: Difference between the highest and lowest YoY % Change.


3. Comparative Metrics
Z-Scores: Standardize the data to compare how extreme each county's rent change is relative to the mean.
Growth Rate Differences: Direct comparison of YoY growth between counties to see which grew fastest.

5. Affordability Metrics
Rent-to-Income Ratio: Shows how rent increases compare to income growth (if income data is available).
Percentage of Income Spent on Rent: Identifies housing cost burdens.

 7. Statistical Tests
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Test if the differences in rent increases between counties are statistically significant.
